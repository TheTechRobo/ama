# Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't **already been answered**. GitHub's duplicate issue tracker is great for this.
- Use an **easily-understood** and **detailed** title and description.
- Feature requests should be opened on the **relevant issue tracker**.
- Support questions and bug reports are better asked on **[my support repo](https://github.com/thetechrobo/support/)**. 
- If you do decide to ask a support question it will probably **never be answered** except "Please post this on the support repo".
- Be **civil** and **polite**.
- **Please,** no **harrassment** or **abuse**. Ignoring this rule **will get you reported**.
- Follow GitHub's **terms of service**. Again, ignoring this rule **will get you reported**.
- Sexual content is **not tolerated** and will be **deleted without notice, whilst reporting you to the GitHub staff.**
